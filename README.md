# 12-Tattooz-Den
This is a HTML,CSS,SASS design of a tattoo parlour website it encompassess the mobile first build in which I built the pages from small,medium to large screen sizes.
On the css I bullt style sheets for the different screen sizes customizing each to respond at different screen size pixels.
To speed up css loading I used Sass to preprocess all my css files and merge into one css file to load when the website is opened.
I used HTML validaor to validate my mark up and CSS validator to validate my css.
The responsive code css will be my backbone for more website builds.
Will be adding screenshots as I go on.
Technologies used - HTML,CSS,SASS
