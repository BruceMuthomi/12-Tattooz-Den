# 12 Tattooz Den

## Introduction

This is a HTML,CSS,SASS design of a tattoo parlour website it encompassess the mobile first build in which I built the pages from small,medium to large screen sizes.

On the css I bullt style sheets for the different screen sizes customizing each to respond at different screen size pixels.

To speed up css loading I used Sass to preprocess all my css files and merge into one css file to load when the website is opened.

I used HTML validaor to validate my mark up and CSS validator to validate my css.
